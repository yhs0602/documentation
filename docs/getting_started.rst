Getting Started
===================================================

There are three main ways to use |RLT|:

====================================================== =============================================================================== =====================
 Approach                                               Pros ✅                                                                         Cons ❌
====================================================== =============================================================================== =====================
:ref:`Python Interface <python-interface>`              - Easy installation: `pip install rltools`                                     - Performance limited by Python environments
                                                        - Compatible with *Gym/Gymnasium* environments                                 - Limited flexibility (fixed algorithms, adjustable hyperparameters)
                                                        - Easiest way to use Intel MKL for acceleration: `pip install rltools[mkl]`
:ref:`Native: In-Source <native>`                       - Full performance                                                             - Versioning issues (this is basically forking |RLT|)
                                                        - Simple setup to reproduce the examples
                                                        - Maintained tuned training configurations in the |RLT| Zoo
:ref:`Native: No CMake <native-no-cmake>`               - Full performance
                                                        - Great for purists who hate CMake and build-systems in general                - No automatic interoperability with IDEs for e.g. debugging
                                                        - Shows that |RLT| is actually dependency-free
:ref:`Native: As a Submodule/Library <native-library>`  - Full performance                                                             - No preconfigured targets like in the |RLT| Zoo
                                                        - Easy versioning by including |RLT| as a submodule
                                                        - Great for implementing your own environments and maintaining them over time
====================================================== =============================================================================== =====================

The No CMake approach is mainly for demonstration purposes to show that |RLT| has no dependencies and to show that there is no hidden magic in the CMake configuration.

Between the latter two native options we recommend to start with the In-Source approach to take advantage of the pre-configured examples in the |RLT| Zoo. Then, when implementing your own environment you probably want to switch to using |RLT| as a library by including it as a submodule in your project.

This quick-start guide mainly focuses on the In-Source approach because it showcases how |RLT| can be set up with minimal dependencies and used to reproduce the |RLT| Zoo training runs.

.. _python-interface:

Python Interface
-----------------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install rltools gymnasium


`gymnasium` is not generally required but we install it for this example.

.. code-block:: python

    from rltools import SAC
    import gymnasium as gym
    from gymnasium.experimental.wrappers import RescaleActionV0

    seed = 0xf00d
    def env_factory():
        env = gym.make("Pendulum-v1")
        env = RescaleActionV0(env, -1, 1)
        env.reset(seed=seed)
        return env

    sac = SAC(env_factory)
    state = sac.State(seed)

    finished = False
    while not finished:
        finished = state.step()

For more information please refer to the :doc:`Python Interface <09-Python Interface>` documentation.


.. _native:

Native: In-Source
------------------

This guide gets you started using |RLT| natively on multiple platforms (Docker / Ubuntu / WSL / macOS).

- **Step 1**: :ref:`Clone the Repository <clone-repository>`
- **Step 2**: :ref:`Run Container (Docker only) <run-docker-container>`
- **Step 3**: Install Dependencies
    - :ref:`Docker & Ubuntu & WSL <install-dependencies-docker-ubuntu-wsl>`
    - :ref:`macOS <install-dependencies-macos>`
- **Step 4**: :ref:`Configure and Build the Targets (all platforms) <configure-and-build>`
- **Step 5**: :ref:`Run an Experiment <run-experiment>`
- **Step 6**: Visualize the Results
    - :ref:`Docker<visualize-docker>`
    - :ref:`Ubuntu & WSL & macOS <visualize-ubuntu-wsl-macos>`

.. _clone-repository:

Step 1: Clone the Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/rl-tools/rl-tools.git

**Note**:
    We don't encourage using the ``--recursive`` flag because we are maintaining |RLT| as a monorepo and some of the submodules contain large files (e.g. data for unit tests or redistributable binaries for releases). |RLT| is designed as a header-only and dependency-free library but for some convenience features like Tensorboard logging, or gzipped checkpointing, additional dependencies are required. We prefer to vendor them as versioned submodules in ``./external`` and they can be instantiated selectively using ``git submodule update --init --recursive -- external/<submodule>``.


.. _run-docker-container:

**Step 2: Run Container (Docker only)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run a Docker container from the cloned directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd rl-tools
    docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/rl_tools,readonly ubuntu:24.04

- ``-p 8000:8000``: **Optional**. Exposes port ``8000`` such that you can use the :doc:`Experiment Tracking <10-Experiment Tracking>` facilities. This exposes a static web server that gives access to a browser-based interface to watch environment rollouts.
- ``--mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/rl_tools,readonly``: We mount the current directory (checked out repository) to ``/rl_tools`` in the container. We use the ``readonly`` flag to ensure a clean, out-of-tree build. The files can still be edited on the host machine using your editor or IDE of choice.
- ``ubuntu:24.04``: We use Ubuntu for this demonstration because of its wide-spread use and familiarity. Due to the minimal requirements of |RLT| (basically only a C++ compiler and CMake and possibly a BLAS library to speed up matrix multiplications) it can also be used on virtually any other system (Windows, macOS and other Linux distros)

Step 3: Install Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _install-dependencies-docker-ubuntu-wsl:

Docker & Ubuntu & WSL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    apt update
    export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
    apt install -y build-essential cmake libopenblas-dev python3

- ``DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive``: Suppresses interactive prompts during package installation (for convenience)

- ``apt install -y``: Installs several dependencies

    - ``build-essential``: Installs the C++ compiler

    - ``cmake``: CMake to configure the different example targets and call the compiler

    - ``libopenblas-dev``: **Optional**. Lightweight BLAS library that provides fast matrix multiplication implementations. Required for the ``-DRL_TOOLS_BACKEND_ENABLE_OPENBLAS=ON`` option. About 10x faster than with the generic implementations that are used by default (when the option is absent). By using a more tailored BLAS library like Intel MKL you might be able to get another ~2x speed improvement

    - ``python3``: **Optional**. Python is used in ``serve.sh`` to host a simple static HTTP server that visualizes the environments during and after training.


.. _install-dependencies-macos:

macOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the Xcode command line tools:

.. code-block:: bash

    xcode-select --install
    brew install cmake

.. _configure-and-build:

Step 4: Configure and Build the Targets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Note**:
    For macOS, replace ``-DRL_TOOLS_BACKEND_ENABLE_OPENBLAS=ON`` with ``-DRL_TOOLS_BACKEND_ENABLE_ACCELERATE=ON``

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake /rl_tools -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DRL_TOOLS_ENABLE_TARGETS=ON -DRL_TOOLS_BACKEND_ENABLE_OPENBLAS=ON
   cmake --build .


- ``cmake /rl_tools``: Using CMake to configure the examples contained in the |RLT| project. The main suit of (tuned) environment configurations we are using is the |RLT| Zoo (see `https://zoo.rl.tools <https://zoo.rl.tools>`_ for trained agents and learning curves).

- ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release``: Sets the build type to ``Release`` to optimize the build for performance (expect a large difference compared to without it).
- ``-DRL_TOOLS_ENABLE_TARGETS=ON``: Enables the building of the example targets. These are turned off by default such that they don't clutter projects that just include |RLT| as a library and do not want to build the examples.
- ``-DRL_TOOLS_BACKEND_ENABLE_OPENBLAS=ON``: Enables the OpenBLAS backend, allowing RL_Tools to utilize OpenBLAS for matrix multiplications (~10x faster than using the generic implementations that are automatically used in the absence of this flag).
- ``cmake --build .``: Builds the targets. You can use an additional e.g. ``-j4`` to speed up the build using 4 parallel threads.

.. _run-experiment:

Step 5: Run an Experiment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Execute e.g. the |RLT| Zoo example using SAC to train the Learning to Fly (l2f) environment.

.. code-block:: bash

   ./src/rl/zoo/rl_zoo_sac_l2f

You can use ``cmake --build . --target help`` to list the available targets.

.. _visualize:

Step 6: Visualize the Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the experiment the training loop emits checkpoints and recorded trajectories a s well as Javscript rendering instructions in the experiment folder following the :doc:`Experiment Tracking <10-Experiment Tracking>` conventions. You can browse the ``experiments`` folder which contains the runs to inspect the checkpoints and other data. |RLT| includes a simple web-based UI to visualize these results.


.. _visualize-docker:

Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To expose the experiment data through the forwarded port of the docker container we copy the files that constitute the web interface into the docker container such that a simple, static HTTP server can expose them together with the experiment data.

.. code-block:: bash

   cp -r /rl_tools/static .
   /rl_tools/serve.sh

After copying the UI files we run ``serve.sh`` which periodically builds an index file containing a list of all experiment files such that the web UI can find them. It also starts a simple Python-based HTTP server on port ``8000``. Now you should be able to navigate to `http://localhost:8000 <http://localhost:8000>`_ and view the visualizations of the training runs.

.. _visualize-ubuntu-wsl-macos:

Ubuntu & WSL & macOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure that the target is run with the cloned repository `rl-tools` as the working directory. This should create an `experiments` folder inside it.

Now we can run ``serve.sh`` which periodically builds an index file containing a list of all experiment files such that the web UI can find them. It also starts a simple Python-based HTTP server on port ``8000``. Now you should be able to navigate to `http://localhost:8000 <http://localhost:8000>`_ and view the visualizations of the training runs.

.. code-block:: bash

   ./serve.sh

.. _native-no-cmake:

Native: No CMake
------------------

.. epigraph::

   "Never underestimate the power of a man armed with nothing but a C++ compiler."

   -- RLtools contributor

The following compiles the |RLT| Zoo example for SAC with the Learning to Fly environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    g++ -Iinclude -std=c++17 src/rl/zoo/zoo*.cpp -DRL_TOOLS_RL_ZOO_ALGORITHM_SAC -DRL_TOOLS_RL_ZOO_ENVIRONMENT_L2F
    ./a.out

- ``-Iinclude``: This is run from the root of the cloned repository folder ``rl-tools`` hence the header search path is ``include``. In Docker this should be adjusted to ``-I/rl_tools/include``.
- ``-std=c++17``: Use the C++17 standard
- ``src/rl/zoo/zoo*.cpp``: Compile the |RLT| Zoo files. In Docker this should be adjusted to ``/rl_tools/src/rl/zoo/zoo*.cpp``.
- ``-DRL_TOOLS_RL_ZOO_ALGORITHM_SAC``: Flag for the |RLT| Zoo that selects the SAC RL algorithm
- ``-DRL_TOOLS_RL_ZOO_ENVIRONMENT_L2F``: Flag for the |RLT| Zoo that selects the Learning to Fly environment
- ``./a.out``: Run the compiled binary

This will be quite slow because no optimizations are applied by default. In the following we instruct the compiler to maximally optimize the code using the compile-time knowledge that |RLT| provides. In particular the sizes of all datastructures and for-loops are known at compile-time and the compiler can unroll loops and inline functions to maximize performance.

.. code-block:: bash

    g++ -Iinclude -std=c++17 -Ofast -march=native src/rl/zoo/zoo*.cpp -DRL_TOOLS_RL_ZOO_ALGORITHM_SAC -DRL_TOOLS_RL_ZOO_ENVIRONMENT_L2F
    ./a.out


With this we observe an ~80x speedup. The added options are:

- ``-Ofast``: Maximally optimize the code and use fast math
- ``-march=native``: Take maximal advantage of the available instructions on the host machine

To further speed up the computations we can use a matrix multiplication backend which we find to give another ~7-10x speedup:

Docker & Ubuntu & WSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    g++ -Iinclude -std=c++17 -Ofast -march=native src/rl/zoo/zoo*.cpp -lblas -DRL_TOOLS_BACKEND_ENABLE_OPENBLAS -DRL_TOOLS_RL_ZOO_ALGORITHM_SAC -DRL_TOOLS_RL_ZOO_ENVIRONMENT_L2F
    ./a.out


macOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    g++ -Iinclude -std=c++17 -Ofast -march=native src/rl/zoo/zoo*.cpp -framework Accelerate -DRL_TOOLS_BACKEND_ENABLE_ACCELERATE -DRL_TOOLS_RL_ZOO_ALGORITHM_SAC -DRL_TOOLS_RL_ZOO_ENVIRONMENT_L2F
    ./a.out

.. _native-library:

Native: As a Submodule/Library
--------------------------------

To use |RLT| as a library you can start from the example `https://github.com/rl-tools/example <https://github.com/rl-tools/example>`_ and use it as a template to implement your own environment. The steps to setup the environment are the same as in :ref:`Native: In-Source <native>`.
